                    <p>Meet Chewie: the sweetest mama you ever did see! Chewie is a 3-year-old purebred Golden Retriever who has spent her life living on our little Christmas tree farm. She gleefully spends her days chasing squirrels and bears, keeping a close eye on "her" chickens and rabbits, and exploring the vast forests of Golden Ears Provincial Park and finding every and any body of water to swim in. In the evenings you can find her curled up contentedly next to her humans and snuggling with her two kittens. She is happiest when with her humans, even the small bouncy ones! Chewie has been raised with young children and animals of all shapes and sizes, and is only every deeply patient and gracious with everyone she meets. Chewie weighs between 45-50 pounds and has a beautiful rich red coat with a bit of a curl to her fur. </p>

                    <p>Meet Sammy: a big, lovable pup at heart! Sammy is a 4 year old purebred Golden Retriever who lives to fetch! He is infamous for carrying three tennis balls in his mouth at one time! Sammy is bilingual, smart as a whip, and very eager to please. He is very gentle with children and other dogs and animals. His perfect day would be a long run on the dykes chasing all the balls (and collecting the ones other pups have missed along the way!), and then crashing by the fire in the evening. Sammy weighs 60 pounds and has a gorgeously smooth red coat. </p>

                 <p>Our pups are born inside our living room so that they can receive very personal and immediate care as they navigate the first couple months of life. Our family gives them names and keeps records of their weights and changes as they grow. Chewie is a wonderfully attentive mother and it seems as if she is counting them each time she enters the whelping box to feed and groom them! Around four weeks of age our puppies get to experience the fresh air, green grass and a delight for the senses as they romp through our garden chasing bugs and butterflies. They are also introduced to solid food (a healthful mix of raw food and puppy kibble), socialise with our cats and friends' dogs (all of whom are up to date on their vaccines), and start their potty training process.

                    From day one, our pups are handled, snuggled and checked over constantly to ensure everyone is eating, playing, sleeping and pooping well. They play daily with our children and as such, develop a calm and friendly disposition towards people of all ages. 
                    
                    At eight weeks old our lovely family veterinarian does a complete physical for each pup, administers the initial vaccines and fills out a health certificate. They also receive a 3-stage deworming to ensure that our pups arrive at their new homes as healthy as possible.   All of our puppies are well on their way to being fully housebroken by the time they are adopted. </p>

                 <p>Meet the Humans: We are a vibrant family of five living on an idyllic Christmas Tree Farm in a rustic corner of Maple Ridge, B.C. We have three wonderful children who are being raised by Chewie (so she says), and they are learning the importance of caring for creation and stewarding the environment through caring for the myriad animals living on our farm. Our favourite days are the ones when we are outside exploring the beautiful world around us, and working hard on our farm to make it a happy and safe place for all who come here.</p>
